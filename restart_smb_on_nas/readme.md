# Restart SMB service on NAS

So I have a very very old and unstable barely functioning NAS on my home network, it's not much with its 256MB ram but it works. 
The problem is every few hours the SMB service seemingly dies for reasons I haven't diagnosed, so as a quick hack, I just use this script to restart the smb service every few hours using cron.
